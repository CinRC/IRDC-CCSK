This is just for me, so it may not make sense. But it can stay public.

- Fix summations not saving life  DONE
- Add more tests
- GUI?
- Enumeration
- Loading examples
- Unicode symbols
- Asymmetrical branch concurrency tau-checking (will a top level branch match tau from left right to right left?)
- Actionable label caching

Ideally, acting should always return a clone.
