This is just for me, so it may not make sense. But it can stay public.

- Explain / add a way to quit the program or to input a different process.
- Add more tests
- GUI?
- Enumeration
- Unicode symbols
- Command args, config file, etc.
-  Fix tests. 
- Loading examples (cf. <https://github.com/peterbro1/RCCS_Impl/issues/15>)
- Add flag to remove debugging info?

Please, when you get a chance, clarify those:

- Asymmetrical branch concurrency tau-checking (will a top level branch match tau from left right to right left?) <= What does that mean?
- Actionable label caching <= What does that mean?
-  Ideally, acting should always return a clone. <= What does that mean? Is this still true?
- Add a way for normal people to change config options <= What does that mean? Isn't that taking care of with the CLI flags?
