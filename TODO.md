- Explain / add a way to quit the program or to input a different process.
- Add more tests
- GUI?
- Enumeration
- Unicode symbols
- Command args, config file, etc.
- Loading examples (cf. <https://github.com/CinRC/IRDC-CCSKissues/15>)
- Cache actionable label collection so it only does the calculations whenever it updates
