This is just for me, so it may not make sense. But it can stay public.

- Explain / add a way to quit the program or to input a different process. => This is https://github.com/CinRC/IRDC-CCSK/issues/54
- Add more tests => This is an on-going process. 
- GUI? => This is a "long term commitment".
- Enumeration => done, with https://github.com/CinRC/IRDC-CCSK/issues/14 
- Unicode symbols => What is that?
- Command args, config file, etc. => Can this be more precise?
- Loading examples => https://github.com/CinRC/IRDC-CCSKissues/15
- Cache actionable label collection so it only does the calculations whenever it updates => What is that?
