Some of the notable ones are are listed below:&#10;&#10;Channel names are referred to as 'Labels'&#10;Parallel operators (|) are referred to as 'Concurrent Processes'&#10;Deterministic operators (+) are referred to as 'Summation Processes'&#10;Label prefixings (a.b.P) are referred to as 'Action Prefix Processes'&#10;CCSK keys (a[k0].b.P) are referred to as 'Label Keys'&#10;&#10;Syntax and Precedence of Operators {#syntax}&#10;&#10;This program follows a slightly modified semantic structure based off of CCSK. Some notes are included below.&#10;&#10;By default, all labels are given implicit null processes (a is implied to represent a.0). This is toggleable using the dN flag.&#10;Channel labels are limited to lowercase english letters [a-z].&#10;Complement channels are represented by an apostrophe before the label, 'a, 'b, etc.&#10;Process names are limited to uppercase english letters [A-Z].&#10;We assume that all channels sharing the same label are duplicates. This means that 'a is the complement to a, 'b to b, and so forth.&#10;Restrictions are applied under the following format: a.P\{a,b,c}.&#10;We assume that the operators have decreasing binding power, in the following order: \a, a., |, +.&#10;This means that a|b\{a} will be interpreted as (a)|(b\{a}).&#10;More specifically, a.a + b | c \{a} is to be read as (a.a) + (b | (c\a)) (infix notation) or + . a a | b \a c (postfix notation).&#10;Of course, parenthesis take precedence over all operators.&#10;Redundant parenthesis are permitted, e.g., (((a)|(b))) will be accepted but interpreted as (a|b).&#10;" wrapText="true" />
